# Authentication

Aerobatic has built-in support for requiring users to login via OAuth with a number of popular providers including Facebook, GitHub, Google, Twitter, Yammer, Instagram, and Salesforce. Once authenticated your app can make API calls to the provider on behalf of the logged user. The platform takes care of all the plumbing of integrating with the provider making it very simple to authenticate users of your app.

## OAuth Flows
In a web application there are two basic approaches that can be implemented: the web server flow (also called explicit OAuth) and the client flow (implicit OAuth). With explicit OAuth, the server initiates the handshake passing along the client ID and secret to the provider then storing the access token that is passed back once the user has granted permission. The client flow works much the same, but as the name implies, JavaScript running in the browser is responsible for both initiating the auth hanshake and storing the token. A good high level overview can be found [here](http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/07/29/1/oauth2-simplified).

Apps running on the Aerobatic platform can utilize either approach, however for the implicit client flow, you have to write the code yourself (or use a client library). The explicit server style is considered the more secure approach and is the one that is baked into the Aerobatic platform requring hardly any code to enable. 

## Implementation Steps
* In the settings for your app in the dashboard click OAuth and select your desired provider from the drop down.
* Register your application with the provider. The appendix below provides links to the pages where you can register your app.
* For the __callback URL__ enter: 

```
http://<your_app_name>.aerobaticapp.com/_auth/callback
```

* Copy the client key and secret and paste them into the corresponding fields in the Aerobatic dashboard.
* For simulator mode you need to register a second app with the oAuth provider, this time with a callback URL of: 

```
http://<your_app_name>--dev.aerobaticapp.com/_auth/callback
```

* In your app repo, create a file `login.html` (in addition to `index.html`). The `login.html` page represents the portion of your app that anonymous users can access. At a minimum it should contain a button or link that prompts the user to login. The URL of this link should be coded to `/_auth`:

```html
<a href="/_auth">Login with Facebook</a>
```

* While the `login.html` page could just be a simple splash page with a login button, it could also be an entire single page app unto itself. For example an eCommerce app might be accessible to anonymous visitors to shop, but the checkout flow requires logging in.
* After the OAuth flow completes Aerobatic will automatically render the `index.html` page. Your JavaScript can access information about the logged in user via the `__config__.user` variable.
* Within your index.html file you'll likely want a logout button. The href for this link should be coded to `/_logout`.

```html
<a href="/_logout">Logout</a>
```

## Making API Calls
Once authenticated you can make calls to the provider's API on behalf of the user. These calls can be made directly from the browser using CORS or JSONP, or you can proxy the calls via the [Aerobatic API proxy]('/docs/api-integration'). In order to make calls from the browser you will need to pass the access token to the API.

Fetching popular photos from Instagram directly:

```js
$.ajax({
  url: "https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/popular",
  dataType: "jsonp",
  data: {
    access_token: __config__.user.accessToken
  },
  success: function(result) {
  }
})
```

Since the Instagram API doesn't support CORS, any non GET requests would need to be routed through the proxy. So for example liking a post:

```js
$.ajax({
  url: "/proxy",
  type: 'POST',
  dataType: "json",
  data: {
    url: encodeURIComponent("https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/{media-id}/likes?access_token=" + __config__.user.accessToken)
  },
  success: function(result) {
  }
})
```

##Implementation Details
As mentioned the Aerobatic OAuth flow utilizes the web server approach. Once authenticated a session cookie is issued which uniquely identifies the logged in user. If the app URL is reloaded in the browser the user's logged in status will be remembered. If a user attempts to hit an authenticated URL, they will be redirected to the `login.html` page. This way a single page load does not serve both anonymous and authenticated users providing a clean separation between the two. This approach builds upon the tried and tested approach to managing authentication in a web app. However once a user is authenticated, the entire app experience takes place within the context of the single `index.html` page.
